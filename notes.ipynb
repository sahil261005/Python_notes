# ## SETS\*\*
# 
# ## A set is a built-in data structure in Python that represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not allow duplicate values, and they do not maintain any order of elements.
# 
# Adding Elements: Use add() method to add an element to a set.
# my_set = {1, 2, 3}
# my_set.add(4)
# print(my_set)
# 
# ## Intersection (& or intersection()): Finds common elements between sets.
# 
# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# intersection_set = set1 & set2 # or set1.intersection(set2) ## & used for finding interection
# print(intersection_set) # Output: {3}
# 
# when you print a set in Python, the output is typically shown in curly braces {}, which indicates that it is a set. This is the default string representation for sets in Python, similar to how lists are shown with square brackets [].
# sets are unordered collections, the order of elements in the resulting list may not match the order in which elements were added to the set.

# scores = list(map(int, input().split())) # Read scores into a list
# This line reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings using split(), converts each string to an integer using map(int, ...), and then stores these integers in a list called scores.
# For example, if the input is 2 3 6 6 5, scores will be [2, 3, 6, 6, 5].
# 
# unique_scores = set(scores) # Remove duplicates
# This line converts the list scores into a set called unique_scores.
# Sets automatically remove duplicates, so if scores was [2, 3, 6, 6, 5], unique_scores will become {2, 3, 6, 5}.
# Using a set is useful because it helps to easily manage duplicates and ensures we only deal with unique scores.

# ## MAP
# 
# The map() function in Python is a powerful and versatile tool used for applying a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and returning an iterator of the results
# 
# syntax of the map() function in Python is:
# map(function, iterable, ...)
# 
# EX:
# string_numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
# 
# # Use map() to convert each string to an integer
# 
# integer_numbers = map(int, string_numbers)
# 
# # Convert the map object to a list to see the result
# 
# integer_numbers_list = list(integer_numbers)
# 
# print(integer_numbers_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# ## any()
# 
# s = abc32df
# has_alphanumeric = any(char.isalnum() for char in s)
# 
# The any() function is a built-in Python function that returns True if at least one element of the iterable it is given is True. If all elements are False, it returns False.
# In this case, the any() function is used to check if there's at least one alphanumeric character in the string s.
# The generator expression char.isalnum() for char in s produces a sequence of Boolean values (True or False) depending on whether each character is alphanumeric.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## IMP
# 
# The for loop uses for i in range(ans):, but ans is a list, and you can't iterate over a list using range in this manner. You should use range(len(ans)) or a more appropriate condition for your goal.
#

# #############################################################
# 
# The s.split(" ") part breaks the string s into a list of words. It uses a space (" ") as the separator. Each word in the original string becomes an element in this list.
# 
# ## s = "hello world"
# 
# ## s.split(" ") # returns ['hello', 'world']
# 
# [i.capitalize() for i in s.split(" ")] is a list comprehension that iterates over each word (i.e., each i) in the list created by s.split(" ").
# The i.capitalize() method is applied to each word. This method capitalizes the first letter of the word and makes the rest lowercase

# len(bin(n)) returns the length of this binary string, which includes the '0b' prefix (for binary numbers)
# if the largest binary number will be '101', which has a width of 3. This loop runs from 1 to n. For each value of i, the function will print i in decimal, octal, hexadecimal (capitalized), and binary forms.

# %% [markdown]
# str(i) converts the number i to a string so that it can be formatted.
# .rjust(width) right-aligns the string representation of i in a field of width equal to the width calculated earlier
# 
# oct(i) converts i to its octal form. For example, oct(5) returns '0o5'.
# [2:] removes the '0o' prefix, leaving just the octal digits.
# .rjust(width) right-aligns the octal digits similarly to the decimal number  
# example: print(f"{'Item'.ljust(10)} {'Price'}")
# 
# # Print each item with its price, right-aligned
# 
# for item, price in zip(items, prices):
# print(f"{item.ljust(10)} {str(price).rjust(5)}")

# 
# Syntax:  
# enumerate(iterable, start=0)
# 
# iterable: Any iterable like a list, tuple, or string.
# start (optional): The starting index (default is 0).
# 
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# 
# It returns a zip object (an iterator) that can be converted into a list, tuple, or dictionary.
# If the iterables have different lengths, zip() stops at the shortest one

# A package is a collection of modules organized in a directory with a special **init**.py file. It allows you to structure your Python code neatly and reuse functionality across multiple projects.
# 
# Think of a package as a folder that contains multiple Python files (modules), and each module contains functions, classes, or variables.
# 
# Let’s create a package named mypackage that contains two modules:
# 
# math_operations.py (for mathematical functions)
# string_operations.py (for string-related functions)
# 
# Create a folder named mypackage in your working directory.
# 
# Step 2: Add an **init**.py File
# Inside mypackage/, create an empty file called **init**.py.
# This file makes mypackage a package. It can also include initialization code if needed.
# 
# USE IT:
# from mypackage.math_operations import add, subtract
# from mypackage.string_operations import uppercase

# use sorted(names)
# to sort a list in a loop
# 

# %% [markdown]
# file.write(names)
# this will write names ike thsi --> sahilomcatdog
# hence to add a new line charachter
# we use:
# 
# file.write(f"{name}\n")
# 

# %%
with open("names.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(f"{name}\n")

# # SORTING
# 
# sorted (iterable, key = None, reverse=False)
# or
# sorted (iterable, key = None, reverse=True)

# `# CSV FILE
# 
# while using CSV files..values are comma seprated sp while looping through the file to get the individual values we need to split it before the commas(")
# 
# DOne by:
# 
# line.split(",") # looks for comma ans splits it
# Ex:
# for line in file:
# row = line.rstrip().split(",")
# print(f"{row[0]} is in the house {row[1]}")
# 
# # import csv
# 
# # csv.reader(file_name)
# 
#     csv.reader used to read all contents of a file, read all commas etc....RETURN LIST
# 
# # csv.DictReader(file_name)
# 
# # csv.writer(file_name)
# 
#     writer.writerow([name, home])
# 
# # csv.DictWriter(file_name)
# 
#      writer.writerow({"name" : name, "home" : home})

# # Regular Expression:
# 
# regular expressions (regex).
# 
# Why regex is useful: searching, validating, and manipulating text data.
# 
# Common use cases: pattern matching, form validation, parsing text files.
# 
# . (dot) - Matches any character except newline.
# ^ - Matches the start of a string.
# $ - Matches the end of a string.
# 
# - - Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding character.
# 
# * - Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding character.
#     ? - Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character.
#     | - OR operator (e.g., cat|dog matches “cat” or “dog”).
# 
# [abc] - Matches any single character a, b, or c.
# [a-z] - Matches any lowercase letter from a to z.
# [0-9] - Matches any digit.
# \d - Matches any digit (0-9).
# # \w : USE TO MATCH WORD CHARACHTERS,NUMBERS AND EVEN UNDERSCORE
# 
# ## Escaping Special Characters
# 
# Using \ to escape metacharacters (e.g., \. matches a literal dot).
# 
# import re
# Key Functions:
# re.search() - Finds the first occurrence of a pattern.
# re.findall() - Returns all matches as a list.
# re.match() - Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.
# re.fullmatch() - Checks if the entire string matches the pattern.
# 
# Flags
# re.IGNORECASE (re.I) - Case-insensitive matching.
# re.MULTILINE (re.M) - Multi-line matching.
# re.DOTALL (re.S) - Allows . to match newline characters.
#

def is_valid_email(email):
    pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"

''''
# Here, we are defining a regular expression pattern to validate an email address. Let's break down this pattern:
🔑 Pattern Breakdown^ - Asserts the position at the start of the string (the email must start with the next part of the pattern).
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+ - This part matches the username before the @.
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] - Matches any letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, dot, underscore, percentage sign, plus, or hyphen.
+ - Ensures that there must be at least one or more valid characters before the @.
@ - Matches the "@" symbol which separates the username from the domain.
[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+ - This part matches the domain name.
[a-zA-Z0-9.-] - Matches any letter, digit, dot, or hyphen.
+ - Ensures there must be at least one or more valid characters before the dot.
\. - Matches a literal dot (.). The \ is used to escape the dot because, in regex, a dot by itself matches any character.
[a-zA-Z]{2,} - This part matches the Top-Level Domain (TLD).
[a-zA-Z] - Matches any letter.
{2,} - Ensures the TLD must be at least 2 characters long (like .com, .org, .edu, etc.).
$ - Asserts the position at the end of the string (the email must end here, nothing should be after the TLD).'

# Great question! The r" at the start is used to define a raw string literal in Python
#  raw string literal tells Python to treat backslashes (\) as literal characters and not as escape characters.
#  Regular expressions often use backslashes to escape special characters,
